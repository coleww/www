# Simple pitch detection
 based on [cwilso's pitch detect](https://github.com/cwilso/PitchDetect) and 
 [some sort of bf->js compiler](http://google.com)

You play guitar, it detects pitch and converts to brainfuck

When the thing blinks, it is detecting and writing a bf character, so play along with the flashy.
